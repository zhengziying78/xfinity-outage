# Internet Connectivity Checker

A Python script that monitors internet connectivity by testing access to popular websites and logs results to daily files.

## Features

- Tests connectivity to multiple websites every minute
- Runs automatically in background, even when laptop is closed

## Usage

You can run the connectivity checker in two ways:

- **Manual run**: Execute the script directly to test connectivity immediately
- **Scheduled run**: Configure it to run automatically at regular intervals

All connectivity results are logged to files organized by date and hostname (e.g., `logs/hostname/connectivity_log_20250709.txt`) and committed to the repository. Each log entry includes timestamp, WiFi network name, and connectivity status for each tested website. 

You can view the log files directly on GitHub: [all logs](https://github.com/zhengziying78/xfinity-outage/tree/main/logs) or [logs from specific hostname](https://github.com/zhengziying78/xfinity-outage/tree/main/logs/Ziyings-MacBook-Pro.local).

For detailed setup instructions and configuration options, see [`setup/README.md`](setup/README.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3 (uses built-in `urllib` and `concurrent.futures` modules, no external dependencies)
- macOS with launchctl for scheduling

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests for all modules. The test suite covers:

- **Logging functionality**: File logging and data preparation
- **Site checking**: HTTP requests, error handling, and concurrent execution
- **Timestamp handling**: Timezone calculations and formatting
- **WiFi detection**: Network name detection via multiple methods

### Running Tests

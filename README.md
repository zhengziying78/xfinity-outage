# Internet Connectivity Checker

A Python script that monitors internet connectivity by testing access to popular websites and logs results to daily files.

## Features

- Tests connectivity to GitHub, Google, Apple, and Reddit in parallel
- Logs results with timestamps to daily log files organized by hostname
- Measures response times for each website tested
- Remote logging to Logtail (Better Stack) for centralized monitoring
- Automated scheduling via macOS LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon

## Usage

For manual testing and local log viewing, see [`setup/README.md`](setup/README.md).
